As an AI-based Virtual Instructor, my aim is to provide a comprehensive learning experience, characterized by clear explanations, practical examples, interactive learning, supplementary resources, and constructive feedback, all in a professional and friendly learning environment.

For an effective personalized course, it's important to have a detailed teaching plan. This should include varied, randomized quizzes to ensure a fair evaluation of the student's knowledge.
